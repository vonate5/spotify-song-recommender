## Project
**Scenario:**
You have been hired as a Data Analyst for Gnod, which is a site that provides recommendations for music, art, literature and products based on collaborative filtering algorithms.

**Challenge:**
Your goal is to create a model that recommends songs based on the features of previous songs that the client likes!

## Process & tools
We use the following tools and methods to achieve the model:
- Python
- Spotify for developers
- Audio features
- Clustering
- Scaling
- Find the optimal K

## Results
Once we import Spotify songs and group them in 28 clusters (based on the [elbow method]()) we manage to create a model that asks you for a song you like and, deppending on the features of the songs, it returns you a similar one and let you listen to it! 
In the next image you can see how it works, but I invite you to click on the [code]() and try it yourself.

Have fun!
